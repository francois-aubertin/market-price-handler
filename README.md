Notes:
- the assignment mentioned that a web server was not necessary, however I took the liberty to
create a Spring Boot project simply because it's simpler to setup (using Spring Initializr).
- There is no unit test for the CSV parser because I assume the purpose of this exercise is not to spend a lot
of time validating and parsing the CSV input. Furthermore, it is being tested by the class ComponentTest (just not the edge cases).
